# OpenCart

## Overview

OpenCart is a free, open-source eCommerce platform for online merchants. OpenCart provides a professional and reliable foundation for building a successful online store.

## Description

This is a customized version of the OpenCart [3.0.x.x](https://github.com/opencart/opencart/tree/3.0.x.x) branch and is **fully compatible** with it as well as other *official* OpenCart 3.x releases. The main difference is that some third-party modules have been removed, mainly payment and shipping modules, Google Shopping, etc. The full list of deleted files can be found [*here*](deleted.txt). Additionally, the PHP code has been beautified and adjusted to meet the [coding standards](https://github.com/opencart/opencart/wiki/Coding-standards).  
The project is actively used, and all *official* fixes are synchronized in a timely manner.
